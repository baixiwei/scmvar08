Conditions:
    Nonvaried
    Adaptively varied
    Yoked random
    Yoked blocked
    Yoked identical
    
Choose condition

    If condition is nonvaried, counterbalance which schema is shown
    
    If condition is adaptively varied, counterbalance among all possible schema orders
    
    If condition is any of yoked, make sure the existing completions for that condition are < those for adaptively varied, and if not, choose another condition
    (We want to ensure that each sid in the adaptively varied condition gets yoked equally often in each of the yoked conditions.)
