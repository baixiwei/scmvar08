x training interface: feedback per question would be shown and then the page regenerated and you have to do again
x   On incorrect answer, highlight incorrects with margin explanations, and give popup explanation, as now.
x   Text of popup explanation should be changed to say read and then click continue to regenerate, with continue button active only after a pause.
x   Disable radio buttons during this time, change submit to continue, reactivate after pause, set to regenerate page.

x set up code for 4 conditions, with variation increasing from 1 schema (PCO) to 3 (PCO, OSS, TFR) after 3 in a row correct
    OR: counterbalance among schemas for nonvaried, and among schema orders for adaptively varied? Depends on outcome of validation.

x data storage

x set up PHP code for condition assignment & yoking
x   Conditions: adaptive variation, yoked random, yoked identical, nonvaried
x   If condition is any of yoked, make sure the existing completions for that condition are < those for adaptively varied, and if not, choose another condition
x   Record condition & subcondition assignment
x   Randomly select yoked sid and extract trial sequence in yoked conditions
x   Record these at assignment as well
x   (We want to ensure that each sid in the adaptively varied condition gets yoked equally often in each of the yoked conditions.)

- discuss with Rob:
    current format of training
    whether to add roles prompt
    whether to change terminology, e.g. 'options' vs 'alternatives', 'selections' vs 'selection events' vs 'times'
    18 training questions?
    use all schemas or only PCO/TFR? always use PCO first?
